 How It Works:
The program starts and notes the current time.

It generates a random expression (like 7+3) and shows it to the user.

The user keeps trying until the correct answer is given.

The total number of wrong attempts is recorded.

At the end, it prints:

A congratulatory message,

Number of wrong attempts,

Total time taken to finish the quiz.
